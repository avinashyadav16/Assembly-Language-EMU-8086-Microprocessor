## DEC Instruction

This simple operation demonstrates how the DEC instruction is used to reduce the value of a register, which is a common task in loop counters and decrementing operations in assembly language programming.

**Format:** `DEC <destination>`

- `DEC` is an instruction used to decrease the value of the destination operand by 1.
- The operation performed is: **`D = D - 1`**, where `D` is the destination operand.
- This instruction is commonly used to decrement the value in a register, memory location, or counter.

### Example:

Let's consider an example where we decrement the number `567AH`.

If we have the hexadecimal value `567AH` stored in the `AX` register and we want to decrement it by 1, the `DEC` instruction will perform the operation as follows:

**Final Answer:** `567AH - 1H = 5679H`

## Sample Code For Understanding: ðŸ”¥

Hereâ€™s a simple "" operation program written in assembly language for TASM:

```assembly

; @file-name: Lecture-06.asm

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;      DEC Operation       ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Move the hexadecimal value 567AH into the AX register.
MOV AX, 567AH

; Decrement the value in the AX register by 1.
DEC AX


; Halt the execution of the program (stop the CPU).
HLT




; Detailed Explanation:

; - MOV AX, 567AH
;       - Operation: The MOV instruction transfers data from the source operand to the destination operand.
;       - Function: This line loads the hexadecimal value 567AH into the AX register.
;       - Registers Involved:
;               - AX: A 16-bit general-purpose accumulator register in the 8086 microprocessor.
;       - After Execution:
;               - The AX register contains the value 567AH.

; - DEC AX
;       - Operation: The DEC (decrement) instruction subtracts 1 from its operand.
;       - Function: This line decrements the value currently in the AX register by 1.
;       - Registers Involved:
;               - AX: The same accumulator register previously loaded with 567AH.
;       - After Execution:
;               - If AX initially held 567AH, after this instruction, it will contain 5679H.
;       - Flags Affected:
;               - Overflow Flag (OF): Set if the result causes a signed overflow.
;               - Sign Flag (SF), Zero Flag (ZF), Auxiliary Carry Flag (AF), Parity Flag (PF): These may also be affected based on the result.

; - HLT
;       - Operation: The HLT (halt) instruction stops the processor from executing further instructions.
;       - Function: This line halts the CPU's operation until the next external interrupt or a reset occurs.
;       - Effect:
;               - The CPU enters a halt state, effectively pausing program execution.
;               - This is typically used to signal the end of a program or to wait for an external event.
