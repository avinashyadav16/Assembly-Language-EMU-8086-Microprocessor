# INC Instruction in Assembly Language

The `INC` instruction is used to increment the value of a destination operand by 1. This operation can be applied to registers or memory locations.

## Format

`INC <destination>`

- **INC**: Increments the value of the destination operand by 1.
- **Operation**: `destination = destination + 1`
- **destination**: Can be a register or memory location.

## Example: Incrementing a 16-bit Number

Let's consider an example where we increment a 16-bit hexadecimal number: `5678H`.

`5678H + 1H`

The increment operation is performed directly:

- 5678H + 1H = `5679H`

So, the final result will be: `5678H + 1H = 5679H`.

For any increment operations, the INC instruction can be used to quickly add 1 to a value stored in a register or memory location, without affecting the Carry flag.

## Sample Code For Understanding: ðŸ”¥

Hereâ€™s a simple "INC" operation program written in assembly language for TASM:

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
;      INC Operation       ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

; Move the hexadecimal value 5678H into the AX register.
MOV AX, 5678H


; Increment the value in the AX register by 1.
INC AX


; Halt the execution of the program (stop the CPU).
HLT



; Detailed Explanation:
; - MOV AX, 5678H
;       - Operation: The MOV instruction copies data from the source operand to the destination operand.
;       - Function: This line moves (loads) the hexadecimal value 5678H into the AX register.
;       - Registers Involved:
;               - AX: A 16-bit general-purpose accumulator register in the 8086 microprocessor.
;       - After Execution:
;               - The AX register contains the value 5678H.

; - INC AX
;       - Operation: The INC (increment) instruction adds 1 to its operand.
;       - Function: This line increments the current value in the AX register by 1.
;       - Registers Involved:
;               - AX: The same accumulator register previously loaded with 5678H.
;       - After Execution:
;               - If AX initially held 5678H, after this instruction, it will contain 5679H.
;       - Flags Affected:
;               - Overflow Flag (OF): Set if the result causes a signed overflow.
;               - Sign Flag (SF), Zero Flag (ZF), Auxiliary Carry Flag (AF), Parity Flag (PF): These may also be affected based on the result.

; - HLT
;       - Operation: The HLT (halt) instruction stops the processor from executing further instructions.
;       - Function: This line halts the CPU's operation until the next external interrupt or a reset occurs.
;       - Effect:
;               - The CPU enters a halt state, effectively pausing program execution.
;               - This is typically used to signal the end of a program or to wait for an external event.
